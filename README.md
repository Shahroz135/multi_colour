           # multi_colour
With the help  of this code we can print
our name in different colours and also wish 
Happy Birthday in a colour which we choose. 
It is to be noted that in C language for printing 
output in different colours we will use letter
'c' before the identifier 'printf' then compiler 
generates output in multiple colours. Otherwise it generates 
Error. There is almost 8 different colours in C language which we 
use in our output.
